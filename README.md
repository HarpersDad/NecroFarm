CSC 491 project


This project was a game design capstone project at Eastern Kentucky University that was built with Unity Engine.  The project was worked on by a team of 3 students, including myself.  It is a top down RTS style game that allows for the creation of fighting units, 
crop production, and land purchase.  The game was not finished before the end of the semester and may never see completion.
